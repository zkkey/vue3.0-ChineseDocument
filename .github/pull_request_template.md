Thanks for your interest in submitting a PR! At this time, because the docs are in beta, the team is currently in the midst of changes. As a result, **we are not ready for additional contributions yet**.

## How can I provide feedback?

To be respectful of your time and ideas, **please [create an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/issues/new) instead of a pull request**. Otherwise, we will have to simply close your pull request at this time.
